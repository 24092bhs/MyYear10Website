        Hi! My name is Eileen and I am in Year Ten at Burnside High School. This year, I have been doing Digital Technologies as one of my choice subjects and I have found it really fun!
        My favourite section, if you couldn't tell, was website design. It has been amazing learning more about coding and applying it to a project which involves both aesthetics and functionality. I hope you enjoy looking at what I have been working on this year!
